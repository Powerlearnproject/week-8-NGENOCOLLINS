1. Import Data:
To import data from your MySQL database into Excel, follow these steps:

Export the Data from MySQL:

Use a query in MySQL to select the necessary data.
Example query:
sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM `Mental Health Facilities`;
SELECT * FROM `Mental Health Disorders`;
SELECT * FROM `Socioeconomic Data Table`;
Export the query results as a .csv file from your MySQL workbench or client.
Import the Data into Excel:

Open Excel and navigate to the Data tab.
Choose Get Data > From Text/CSV.
Select the .csv file you exported and import it.
Clean and Structure Data:

Ensure the data types (numbers, dates, etc.) are correctly formatted in Excel.
Use Text to Columns (under the Data tab) to separate values if needed.
